# Virtual Internship

# Whoami

Hi there! This is [Jym from Singapore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jymcheong/). I am a Principal Engineer with [ST Engineering Info-Security Pte Ltd](https://www.stengg.com/cybersecurity). 

Some of the things I did over the years:

- As an Intern, implemented the first multi-user WinCE encryption solution deployed for Singapore Police Force Traffic Enforcement command
- Knowledge transfer (from vendor's country to Singapore) & QA engineer who tested the first batch of E-Passport scanners deployed (& still in operations) within Singapore Immigration and Checkpoints Authority
- Bug finder for (early version of) SingPass National Authentication Hardware-Security-Module "high-trust-zone" implementation
- High-volume data-pipeline test design & execution for a Ministry's SOC
- Delivered ST Engineering SOC on-time, on-target & within budget by leading technical specification, vendor evaluation & project leadership 
- Trained interns, fresh-grads & mid-career as part of our Test-&-Evaluation team to objectively assess some state-of-the-art (then) stuff like Malware Sandboxes, Continuous Validation, UEBA, EDR, Browser-Isolation & so on that are now buzz words
- Principle author of [OpenEDR](https://github.com/jymcheong/OpenEDR) (not to be confused with Comodo Security's version with the same name) & other [open-sourced tools](https://github.com/jymcheong).

# Why Virtual Internship?

[Sam Poder](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-poder/?originalSubdomain=sg) contacted me to ask if I was keen as a mentor with [CodeDay](https://www.codeday.org), but unfortunately I have limited bandwidth due to family & day-job commitments. That encounter gave me an idea: why settle with "constraints" due to budget, office-space, school schedules & so on? 

> When we are willing to learn, we will make time & find the right resources to reach our goals.

This COVID-19 pandemic showed us that we can be equally productive working & learning from anywhere other than office :D

# How?

## Github-as-a-collaboration-Platform

Gitlab too! Regardless of preference, we should fully leverage all these awesome platforms. Benefits?

- Microsoft data-centers have a way better <u>up-time</u> than let's say a self-host git-server within a dusty old server running under a table.
- [Free but scalable](https://github.com/pricing)!
- Flexibility, we can turn `Issues` into anything by using appropriate tags. 
- Comments & notifications for async communications

## Reusable Mini-Problems for Students

As a team-lead of my office's Test-&-Evaluation group, I once tasked a mid-career programmer to write a simple program by ***spelling out some technical specifications***. 

After which, he coded the simple background/hidden app & we tested on our office laptops that were being monitored by so call "State-of-the-Art" detection manned by a team of monitoring crew. No one stopped us from "stealing" files from our own laptop with his custom malware. 

> I taught him & my bosses a simple but important lesson; writing evasive malware is not rocket-science.   

Similarly for this Virtual-Internship, I will craft a series of [Issues](https://github.com/jymcheong/Virtual-Internship/issues) for those who are willing to explore & learn in the process of solving them. I will make time to provide pointers & recommendations but don't dig my brain for free consultancy please ;P

## Show-Case Your Work

Some jobs are expecting some form of experience. Having a [Github account to show your contributions is helpful](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/7fyir1/do_employers_look_at_github_projects/): 

> You don't gain work-experience from reading textbooks, you should be solving something relevant.

Networking during Internship may be useful for specific companies, but your competency as an engineer that you can show-case in a borderless world could bring bigger opportunities beyond what you can find in your country.
